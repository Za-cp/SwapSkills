# SwapSkills

The Skill Swap Project is a community-driven platform that enables users to exchange knowledge and skills without monetary transactions. Each user creates a profile with their full name, bio, skills, location, timezone, and availability, making it easy to showcase what they can teach and what they want to learn. A matching system connects users with complementary skills, while search and filter features allow discovery by skill type or location. Users can send requests to initiate swaps and communicate through an integrated chat or messaging system. The dashboard provides a clear overview of requests, active swaps, and progress. Secure authentication and profile management are powered by Supabase, ensuring data protection. By fostering peer-to-peer learning, the project creates an inclusive environment where individuals can share expertise, build connections, and grow their knowledge collaboratively.
